# Channel Schedule Challange 

The coding challange was completed using ReactJS, CSS.
The only dependancy is moment.js for manipulating data and time formats.

**In the sample data provided the image placeholder URLs were dead links so I took the liberty to adjust them using another image placeholder service. The updated data sample is called channel-fix.json
